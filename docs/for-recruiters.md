# For Recruiters — rag-copilot-it-security

## Status (important)
This repository is currently in **Phase 0: documentation & architecture**.
There is **no runnable application yet**.

The goal of Phase 0 is to define an enterprise-grade, local-first design before implementation.

## What you can evaluate today
- System architecture and RAG flows: `docs/architecture.md`
- Governance mindset (citations, strict mode, audit/export, staleness radar)
- Delivery planning and workflow: `docs/project-management.md`

---

## What will be runnable (planned)
**Milestone M1 (MVP) will include:**
- Local-first CLI (no paid APIs required)
- Ollama + open models as default runtime
- Ingest → index → ask flow
- Mandatory ranked citations
- Strict Mode (“Not found” when evidence is insufficient)
